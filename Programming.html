            <tr>
                <td>Performance Testing: Testing how the software performs under different workloads. Load testing, for example, is used to evaluate performance under real-life load conditions.</td>

It enables software to be validated in realistic test environments earlier in the process â€“ improving design and reducing risks.</td>
                <td>Configuration Management: Organizations centrally maintain test assets and track what software builds to test. Teams gain access to assets such as code, requirements, design documents, models, test scripts and test results. Good systems include user authentication and audit trails to help teams meet compliance requirements with minimal administrative effort.</td>

            <tr>
                <td>Service Virtualization: Testing environments may not be available, especially early in code development. Service virtualization simulates the services and systems that are missing or not yet completed, enabling teams to reduce dependencies and test sooner. They can reuse, deploy and change a configuration to test different scenarios without having to modify the original environment.</td>
                <td>Defect or "bug tracking": Monitoring defects is important to both testing and development teams for measuring and improving quality. Automated tools allow teams to track defects, measure their scope and impact, and uncover related issues.</td>
