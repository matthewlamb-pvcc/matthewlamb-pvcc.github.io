<h2>History of the National Park Service</h2>
<p>The National Park Service is the government agency responsible for promoting and regulating the use of the national parks of the United States and to conserve the scenery, natural and historic objects, and the wildlife within.</P>
    <p>The idea for the National Parks originated from an artist named George Catlin. In 1832 he travelled to the Dakotas and on this trip, he hatched a solution to the perceived danger of an encroaching society. He wrote that what the country needed was a government policy to protect wildlife and the beauty of nature. </P>
    <p>In 1872, Congress established Yellowstone National Park in Montana and Wyoming under the control of the Secretary of the Interior and after this began a movement for the further establishment of national parks. After the establishment of Yellowstone, the United States authorized additional national parks which were also administered by the Department of the Interior although other monuments and natural and historical areas were administered by the War Department and the Forest Service of the Department of Agriculture. The parks were not managed by one agency. This created a problem in which no one agency had authority over our national parks and monuments and so these sites received uneven attention and minimal federal support. </P>
    <p>In 1915, businessman Stephen T. Mather came to Washington from Chicago to be a special assistant to Secretary of the Interior Franklin K. Lane for national park concerns. His efforts to build public and political support for the parks helped persuade Congress to create the first National Park Service. On August 25, 1916, President Woodrow Wilson signed the Organic Act which officially created the National Park Service within the Department of the Interior. In May 1917, Mather was appointed the first NPS director and continued to promote park access, development, and use and contributed generously to the parks from his personal fortune. </P>
    <p>In 1933 President Herbert Hoover passed the Reorganization Act which gave the president the authority to transfer national monuments from one government agency to another. Later that year newly elected President Franklin Delano Roosevelt issued an executive order which transferred the national monuments and military sites from the Forest Service and the War Department to the National Park service. </P>
    <p>In 1970 Congress declared in the General Authorities Act that the National Park System would include all natural, historic, and recreation areas in every region. </P>
    <p>Today the National Park System is made up of more than 400 areas covering more than 84 million acres in 50 states, the District of Columbia, American Samoa, Guam, Puerto Rico, Saipan, and the Virgin Islands. </P>
    <p>Today the National Park Service employs more than 20,000 people. </P>
    <p>In 2011 the National Park System received 278.9 million recreational visits and park visitors spent $12.95 billion in local gateway regions (within roughly 60 miles of the park). </P>
    <p>The 19th and current director of the National Park Service is Charles F. “Chuck” Sams III.</P>
    <p>The mission statement of the National Park Services today is as follows: “The National Park Service preserves unimpaired the natural and cultural resources and values of the National Park System for the enjoyment, education, and inspiration of this and future generations. The National Park Service cooperates with partners to extend the benefits of natural and cultural resource conservation and outdoor recreation throughout this country and the world”. </P>
    <p>In 1951 the arrowhead was authorized as the official emblem of the National Park Service. The different parts of the emblem represent what the National Park Service is here to protect. The sequoia represents vegetation, the bison represents wildlife, the mountains and water represents scenic beauty and recreation, and the arrowhead represents historical and archaeological value. </P>
